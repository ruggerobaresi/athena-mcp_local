# Protocol 244: Offensive Reframing (Incentive Physics)

> **Core Principle**: Don't defend your integrity (words). Prove your incentive physics (constraints). Integrity is a story; incentives are physics.

## 0. Prerequisites
>
> **Warning**: You must have high domain competence to use this.
> If you try to explain "How a scammer works" but get the details wrong, you prove you are neither honest nor competent.
> **You must know the Dark Arts to renounce them.**

## 1. The Dynamic

When a counterparty asks a "Trust Question" (e.g., "How do I know you won't steal my money?"), they are asking for **reassurance**.
Most people answer with **defense**: "I promise I am honest." (Weak. Words are cheap).
The High-Agency answer is **offense**: "If I were going to steal, I wouldn't do it *this badly*." (Strong. Proof via Competence).

> [!WARNING]
> **The Sociopath Trap**: This strategy proves you *know* how to hurt them. If delivered without warmth, it signals "Calculated Predator."
> **Fix**: You must frame the "Dark Strategy" not just as immoral, but as **strategically inferior**.
>
> * *Bad*: "I could steal your money, but I won't." (Trust me).
> * *Good*: "Stealing your money is short-term thinking. I am playing a long-term reputation game. Churning this account kills the golden goose."

## 2. The Mechanism (Reductio + Constraints)

You validate their fear by taking it to its logical extreme, showing your current behavior is incompatible with a bad actor's incentives, and then **locking it in with a constraint**.

### The Formula

1. **Accept the Frame**: "That is a valid fear. Let's explore it."
2. **Optimize the Defect**: "If I *were* going to [Screw You], I wouldn't do [Current Action]. I would do [Optimal Scam]."
3. **Contrast**: "But I am doing [Current Action]. So either I am the world's worst scammer, or I am actually playing the Long Game."
4. **The Constraint (Critical)**: "But you shouldn't trust my math either. Let's set up [Constraint] so I *can't* do that."

## 3. Applications

| Scenario | Fear | Offensive Reframe + Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consulting** | "Will you drag this out?" | "If I wanted to milk this, I wouldn't give you a Flat Fee. I'd ask for 'Time & Materials' with vague scope. That is how consultants buy Ferraris—by shifting risk to the client. By giving you a Fixed Price, I accept the risk. If I drag it out, I lose money."<br>**Constraint**: Fixed Price + Defined Deliverables. |
| **Dating** | "Are you just using me?" | "If I was just looking for a hookup, I would have bailed three hours ago when the conversation got heavy. Players look for the easy yes (Path of Least Resistance). I'm still here because I'm actually interested in *you*."<br>**Constraint**: Consistent Investment (Time/Action). |
| **Hiring** | "Will you leave in 3 mo?" | "If I wanted a quick hop, I wouldn't be grilling you this hard on the 5-year equity vesting schedule."<br>**Constraint**: 1-Year Cliff on Equity. |

## 4. Guardrails

### When to Use

* **Generic Trust Anxiety**: When the person is rational but fearful.
* **Established Status**: You must have established competence first.

### When NOT to Use

* **Regulations**: In finance/healthcare, "joking" about fraud can be a compliance violation.
* **Trauma**: Do not use Reductio logic on deep emotional trauma.
* **Process Proof**: If they need a SOC2 report, give them a SOC2 report.
