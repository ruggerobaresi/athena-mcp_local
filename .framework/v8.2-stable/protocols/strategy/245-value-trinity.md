# Protocol 245: The Value Trinity (Evaluation Framework)

> **Core Principle**: "I don't care how hard the machine works; I care how fast I go."
> **Shift**: From Vanity Metrics (Time/Effort) → Outcome Metrics (Agency/Growth/Assets).

## 1. The Trinity (With Anti-Gaming Constraints)

When evaluating a session, project, or day, use this 3-part scorecard with strict anti-gaming rules.

### I. Agency (What I Did)

* **Definition**: The exercise of High-Agency decision making.
* **Metric**: The "Schlep Delta" — did you solve problems you would have previously avoided?
* **Anti-Gaming**: **Decision Irreversibility**. Did you make a High-Stakes commitment or remove a bottleneck? "Thinking about it" scores 0.
* **Key Question**: "Did I act like an Owner or an Employee?"

### II. Learning (What I Know)

* **Definition**: The acquisition of new schemas or capabilities.
* **Metric**: New Nodes in Knowledge Graph.
* **Anti-Gaming**: **Retention/Reuse**. A new node only counts if it is *used* (cited, applied) within 7 days.
* **Key Question**: "Am I smarter now than I was 2 hours ago?"

### III. Assets / Results (What I Have)

* **Definition**: The tangible asset produced or external impact delivered.
* **Metric**: Asset Velocity (Time to Ship) & Adoption.
* **Anti-Gaming**: **Adoption/Pull**. Did anyone (even you, later) use it?
* **Key Question**: "What can I show for this?"

## 2. Scoring Rubric (0-2 Scale)

**Total Score: __ / 6**

| Pillar | 0 Points (Fail) | 1 Point (Pass) | 2 Points (Exceptional) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agency** | Mostly reactive; avoided the hard thing. | Took ownership in one key moment (Schlep / Decision). | Made a high-stakes commitment or removed a major bottleneck. |
| **Learning** | No new model / Repeated known mistake. | New concept captured + applied once. | Belief updated *and* encoded into a reusable protocol/checklist. |
| **Assets** | Nothing durable produced. | Durable artifact exists (draft, PR, script). | Artifact is live + used (by market or workflow). |

## 3. Usage: Post-Session Review

Copy/Paste this template for the session verdict:

```text
**Post-Session Review**
- **Agency (0-2):**  
  - Hard decision / ownership action: ___
  - Schlep completed: ___
- **Learning (0-2):**  
  - New/updated belief: ___
  - Where it was applied: ___
- **Assets (0-2):**  
  - Shipped asset / impact: ___
  - Is it live + used? Evidence: ___

**Total:** __/6
**One-sentence truth:** ___
```

## 4. Relationship to Protocol 010

* **Protocol 010 (Success Trinity)** defines the **Machine** (Inputs: Docs, Workflows, Practices).
* **Protocol 245 (Value Trinity)** defines the **Destination** (Outputs: Agency, Learning, Assets).

> Use 010 to build the car. Use 245 to check if you reached the destination.
