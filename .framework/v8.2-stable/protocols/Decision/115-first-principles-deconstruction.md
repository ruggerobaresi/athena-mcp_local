## 5-Step Deconstruction Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Goal (Real vs Stated)

```
Stated Goal: [What user verbally wants]
Revealed Goal: [What their actions optimize for]

Diagnostic Questions:
├─ "If I gave you [stated goal] free tomorrow, would you take it?"
├─ "In the past 30 days, what have you actually spent time/money on?" (revealed priorities)
├─ "If getting [X] required giving up [Y], would you?"
└─ Analysis: Are stated and revealed goals aligned?

If misalignment >20% → STOP, prioritize their actual optimization function ⚠️
```

### Step 2: Decompose to Physical/Chemical Layer

```
Question: "What is this goal at the molecular/physical level?"

Examples:
├─ "Nutritious meal" → Protein molecules + vitamins + minerals
│   └─ Raw cost: Amino acids, micronutrients (commodity prices)
├─ "Employability" → Skill proof (portfolio) + network
│   └─ Raw cost: GitHub account (free) + projects + LinkedIn
├─ "Romantic relationship" → Oxytocin bonding + mutual attraction
│   └─ Raw cost: Shared time + emotional disclosure + compatibility
└─ "Learning" → Neural pathway formation
    └─ Raw cost: Focused attention + deliberate practice

Bottom-up question: "What is the minimum physical requirement?"
```

### Step 3: Map Current Cost Structure (Markup Archaeology)

```
Physical minimum cost: $X
Current market cost: $Y
Markup ratio: Y/X = ___

Decompose markup into components:
├─ Retail markup: ___% (removable via bulk)
├─ Rent/overhead: ___% (fixed cost, can be subsidized)
├─ Labor: ___% (reducible via process design)
├─ Marketing: ___% (removable if pay-for-results)
├─ Regulatory cost: ___% (policy choice)
└─ Monopoly rent: ___% (artificial scarcity)

Identify: Which parts are PHYSICS (unavoidable) vs POLICY (removable)?
```

### Step 4: Attack Vectors (Prioritize Largest Markup Sources)

```
Rank markup components by:
├─ Size (percentage of total cost)
├─ Removability (easy vs hard to eliminate)
└─ Impact (affects quality or just price?)

Attack priority: Large + Easy to remove + High impact

Examples:
├─ Affordable meals: Retail markup (77%) → Bulk procurement center
├─ SkillsFuture: Provider revenue decoupled from outcomes → ISA model
├─ Housing: Land cost (artificial) → Release land supply
└─ Healthcare: Drug prices (monopoly) → Bulk purchasing
```

### Step 5: Reconstruct from First Principles

```
New cost structure (optimized):
├─ Raw materials: $X (physics, unavoidable)
├─ Optimized overhead: $Y (minimized)
├─ Efficient process: $Z (redesigned)
└─ Total: $X + $Y + $Z (approaching physical minimum)

Validate economic viability:
├─ Supplier profit: Sustainable? (>10% net)
├─ User cost: Affordable? (within budget)
├─ Government subsidy: Minimized? (attack inputs not outputs)
└─ Incentive alignment: All parties benefit? (>60/100 alignment score)

If any fails → Redesign, don't proceed ⛔
```

## Input vs Output Subsidy Framework

**Key Principle**: Subsidize INPUTS (low cost) or OUTCOMES (aligned incentives), NEVER mandate output prices (creates perverse incentives).

| Approach | Mechanism | Supplier Incentive | Quality | Sustainability | Cost |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|----------------|------|
| **Mandate Output ❌** | "Sell X at price Y" (no subsidy) | Sacrifice quality to survive | Collapse | Unsustainable | Gov: $0 (but system failure) |
| **Output Subsidy 🟡** | Pay supplier per unit sold | Maximize volume, ignore outcomes | Medium | Medium | Gov: High (pay for activity) |
| **Input Subsidy ✅** | Subsidize expensive inputs + rent | Maintain quality, sustainable profit | High | High | Gov: Low (bulk saves) |
| **Outcome Subsidy ✅✅** | Pay only for verified outcomes (ISA) | Maximize outcomes | Highest | Highest | Gov: Medium-low (pay for success only) |

### Decision Tree

```
Government wants outcome X at affordable price
    ↓
Q1: Can suppliers profitably provide X at target price?
    ├─ Yes → No intervention needed ✅
    └─ No → Continue to Q2

Q2: Why is cost too high?
    ├─ Expensive inputs → Input subsidy (bulk procurement)
    ├─ High fixed costs → Rent/overhead subsidy
    ├─ Process inefficiency → Provide optimization templates
    └─ Lack of quality incentive → Pay-for-outcomes

Q3: Can we measure outcomes?
    ├─ Yes → Outcome subsidy (ISA model) ✅✅
    └─ No → Input subsidy (attack largest cost drivers) ✅

NEVER: Mandate output prices without subsidy ⛔
Result: Quality collapse, malicious compliance, system failure
```

### Global Case Studies

| Policy | Type | Outcome |
|--------|------|---------|
| Singapore Affordable Meals | Mandate Output ❌ | 0/40 nutrition compliant |
| Singapore SkillsFuture | Output Subsidy 🟡 | 20% employment rate, decoupled revenue |
| US Coding Bootcamps (ISA) | Outcome Subsidy ✅✅ | 75-85% employment rate, aligned incentives |
| German Apprenticeship | Input Subsidy + Employer co-design ✅ | 85-90% employment rate |
| Venezuela Price Controls | Mandate Output ❌ | Shortages, black markets, collapse |
| Nordic Healthcare | Input Subsidy (bulk drug purchasing) ✅ | High quality, sustainable |

## ISA Model Details (Income Share Agreements)

```
Structure:
├─ Student pays $0 upfront
├─ Provider paid ONLY if student gets employed (S$1,500/placement)
├─ Payment: 10% of income growth × 12 months
├─ Global success rate: 60-75% (verified)
└─ Cost: 6,000 placements need S$27M (vs current S$500M = 18.5x cheaper)

Why it works:
├─ Provider incentive: Maximize student employment (not enrollment)
├─ Quality forced up: Can't get paid with bad training
├─ Risk shifted: Provider bears failure risk, not student
└─ Alignment: Everyone wins when student succeeds ✅
