**Type:** Protocol
**Tag:** #decision #strategy #einstein
**Version:** 1.0

## Core Principle
"If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."

## Procedure
1. **Stop:** Do not immediately jump to solution mode.
2. **Analyze:** Deconstruct the problem statement.
    - Is it the root cause?
    - What are the constraints?
3. **Reframe:** Rewrite the problem in at least 3 distinct ways.
4. **Solve:** Only after reframing, propose a solution.

## Usage
Apply this protocol when facing complex, ambiguous tasks.
