## Core Principle

> **"Reasoning is not a Line. It is a Network."**

Standard LLM reasoning (Chain of Thought) is linear: `A -> B -> C`.
**Graph of Thoughts (GoT)** is topological: `A -> (B1, B2, B3) -> Score -> Convergence -> C`.

It models human "brainstorming" where multiple possibilities are explored, critiqued, and synthesized before a final conclusion is reached.

## The GoT Topology

When executing **Phase 2 (Solution)** of the [Einstein Protocol](../decision/123-einstein-protocol.md), use this flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Node1(Problem State) --> Gen{Generate Operations}
    
    subgraph Divergence
        Gen --> PathA(Path A: Aggressive/High Risk)
        Gen --> PathB(Path B: Safe/Low Yield)
        Gen --> PathC(Path C: Lateral/Asymmetric)
    end
    
    subgraph Evaluation
        PathA --> ScoreA[Score: Risk vs Reward]
        PathB --> ScoreB[Score: Stability]
        PathC --> ScoreC[Score: Opportunity Cost]
    end
    
    subgraph Convergence
        ScoreA & ScoreB & ScoreC --> Agg[Aggregate: Synthesis]
    end
    
    Agg --> Final(Optimal Strategic Path)
```

## Operations Manual

### 1. `Generate` (Divergence)

**Command**: "Generate 3 distinct approaches to this problem. Do not evaluate yet. Just generate."

* **Mode 1**: Direct Attack (Logic)
* **Mode 2**: Flanking Maneuver (Social/Psychological)
* **Mode 3**: Inversion (What if we do nothing?)

### 2. `Score` (Critique)

**Command**: "Critique each path. Assign a 0-10 score based on [Survivability] and [Upside]."

* Apply **The Right of Way Fallacy**: Does this path rely on being "Right" or being "Alive"?
* Apply **Law #1**: Does this path risk Ruin? (If yes, Score = 0).

### 3. `Aggregate` (Convergence)

**Command**: "Synthesize the best elements of the top paths. Discard the weak elements."

* Don't just pick one. **Merge them**.
* *Example*: "Take the Aggression of Path A but buffer it with the Safety Protocols of Path B."

## Integration with Athena

This protocol is the **Engine** for:

1. **`/ultrathink`**: Automatically activates GoT topology.
2. **Complex Social Dynamics**: Used to map "Move vs Counter-Move" (Game Theory).
3. **Code Architecture**: Used to evaluate "Quick Fix" vs "Refactor".
