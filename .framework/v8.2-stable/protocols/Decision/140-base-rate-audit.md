# Protocol 140: Base Rate Audit

> **Purpose**: Heuristic for detecting "nonsense" (fabrication, delusion, or omission) by comparing claims against statistical baselines.

## Core Logic

When a claim significantly exceeds the base rate for its relevant demographic, a **Hidden Variable** must exist to bridge the gap.

```
IF (Claimed Outcome) >> (Expected Outcome for Demographics)
THEN (Hidden Variable) EXISTS
```

**The Diagnostic Question**: "What is the mechanism that bridges the gap between Base Rate and Claim?"

---

## The Hidden Variable Spectrum

When the gap is unexplained, the Hidden Variable typically falls into one of these buckets (in descending order of probability):

1. **Hidden Capital**: Family money, inheritance, unearned windfall.
2. **Hidden Cost**: Extreme leverage, illegal activity, selling soul (OF, sugar).
3. **Hidden Variance**: Survivorship bias (showing 1 winner, hiding 99 losers).
4. **Fabrication**: The claim is simply a lie (engagement bait).
5. **Genuine Outlier**: The <0.1% talent/luck combination (The "Blue Curve").

**Heuristic**: It is almost never #5 unless proven otherwise. Assume #1-4 first.

## Domain Audits

### 1. Wealth & Success

| Claim | Base Rate | Gap | Likely Hidden Variable |
|-------|-----------|-----|------------------------|
| "Condo at 25" | Savings ~$50k | $200k Down Payment | Parents / Inheritance / Windfall |
| "$10M in 2 years" | 90% Fail | Survival Rate | Survivor Bias / VC Connects / Fraud |
| "30 under 30" | Normal Career | Accelerated Status | Nepotism / Rich Parents / Bought Title |

### 2. Trading & Finance

| Claim | Base Rate (Best in World) | Gap | Diagnosis |
|-------|---------------------------|-----|-----------|
| "20% Monthly Guaranteed" | BNF ~15% (Unguaranteed) | +5% + Certainty | **SCAM** / Delusion / Ponzi |
| "90% Win Rate" | HFT ~55-60% | +30% | Martingale Strategy (Blowing up soon) |

### 3. Dating & Social

| Claim | Base Rate | Gap | Likely Hidden Variable |
|-------|-----------|-----|------------------------|
| "He likes me for me" (Age Gap) | Homogamy (Like dates Like) | 20 Year / Status Gap | Transactional ($$$) / Fetish / Status Proxy |
| "Natural Body Transformation" | 2lb muscle/month (Newbie) | 20lb muscle/3 months | PEDs / TRT / Surgery |

## The Development Execution Standard Response

When a prospect/lead presents a claim or expectation that fails the Base Rate Audit (e.g., "I want 20% guaranteed returns"):

1. **Do Not Debate**: You cannot logic someone out of a delusion.
2. **Do Not Negotiate**: Discounts do not fix reality gaps.
3. **Disengage**: "I cannot meet that expectation. Good luck."

> **Rule**: If the gap between Expectation and Reality is structural (>50%), they are not a client. They are a liability.

## Strategic Integrity

Applying this to yourself is **Epistemic Rigor**:

- Acknowledge your own Hidden Variables (e.g., "I date across age gaps because of Transactional Capital, not raw attraction").
- This moves you from **Delusion** (Red Curve grinding) to **Strategy** (Blue Curve leverage).
