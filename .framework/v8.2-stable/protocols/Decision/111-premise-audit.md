# Protocol 111: Premise Validation Protocol (阶段0.5)

> **Status**: HARVESTED (Dec 2025)  
> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex v5.1  
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Gates all other analysis)

## Core Concept

**Mandatory gate before ANY analysis**: Validate that the PREMISE is correct before investing in analysis.

**Einstein Protocol (55/5 Rule)**:

- 55 minutes: Define the actual problem
- 5 minutes: Execute the solution
- Ratio: 11:1 (problem definition is 11x more valuable)

## Phase 0.5: Premise Audit (MANDATORY)

Run these 6 checks before any substantive analysis:

### Q1: Is the stated goal the REAL goal?

```
├─ Run Revealed Preference analysis
├─ "If I gave you [stated goal] free tomorrow, would you take it?"
├─ "What have you actually spent time/money on in the past 30 days?"
└─ If misalignment >20% → STOP, diagnose real goal first ⛔
```

### Q2: Is this problem at the stated level?

```
├─ User claims it's L0-L1 (tactical/strategic)
├─ Run level diagnosis: Is root cause at L2-L4? (arena/archetype/existential)
├─ If root cause 2+ levels higher → STOP, solve at correct level ⛔

Level Stack:
L4: Existential ("Why pursue this at all?") → Identity/values
L3: Archetype ("Why this approach?") → Form vs Substance
L2: Arena ("Why play this game?") → Table selection
L1: Strategic ("How to win?")
L0: Tactical ("Best move?")
```

### Q3: Does the user have a baseline model for this domain?

```
├─ "Have you observed 20+ successful real-world cases of this?"
├─ "Can you specifically describe what success looks like?"
└─ If No → STOP, Observation Phase (6-12 months) needed first ⛔

See: Protocol 113 - Missing Baseline Model
```

### Q4: Is this a Form-Substance Gap torture?

```
├─ "Are you experiencing something 'close to' what you want, but missing a key part?"
├─ "Since getting closer, has the craving INTENSIFIED or diminished?"
└─ If Yes → STOP, Pivot or Mourn, don't optimize current path ⛔

See: Law #37 - Form vs Substance Gap
```

### Q5: Is this a Randy Paradox situation?

```
├─ Run 5-question Randy Detection Protocol
├─ L1 (Truth) + L2 (Fiction) + L3 (Punishment) + L4 (Mechanism) present?
└─ If 4/5 confirmed → STOP, don't advise truth-telling or system-fighting ⛔

See: Protocol 117 - Randian Dilemma
```

### Q6: Is this Limerent Reality Distortion?

```
├─ "Have you asked the obvious falsifying question?"
├─ "What would prove you wrong?"
└─ If avoiding truth → STOP, force reality-testing first ⛔

See: Protocol 114 - Limerent Reality Distortion
```

---

## Gate Decision

```
IF all 6 checks pass:
└─ Proceed to Analysis ✅

IF any check fails:
└─ Address root cause BEFORE tactical/strategic analysis ⛔
└─ Continuing = Protocol 123 (Einstein) violation (efficiently solving wrong problem)
```

---

## Universal Failure Detection Protocol

**Mandatory pre-response check (10 seconds)**:

```
☐ Premise Audit: Is stated goal real? (Q1)
☐ Level Audit: Problem at correct level? (Q2)
☐ Baseline Audit: User has mental model? (Q3)
☐ Form-Substance Audit: Not chasing form? (Q4)
☐ Randy Scan: Not a stable bad equilibrium? (Q5)
☐ Attachment Scan: Not protecting fantasy? (Q6)

Threshold:
├─ 1/5 failure = Warning ⚠️
├─ 2+/5 failure = Refuse to proceed, restructure ⛔
```

---

## Response Quality Gate

**Before delivering any analysis, verify**:

```
✅ Correct premise identified (not efficiently solving wrong problem)
✅ Correct level addressed (not optimizing L0 when L3 is broken)
✅ Baseline model considered (observation phase if missing)
✅ Form-Substance gap diagnosed (pivot or mourn, not intensify)
✅ Randy Paradox handled (focus sovereignty, not activism)
✅ Attachment addressed (force falsifying questions)
✅ First Principles applied (input cost vs markup archaeology)
✅ Incentive alignment validated (stakeholders benefit, not exploited)
✅ Singapore context calibrated (face culture, Randy, arena physics)

Quality Gate: If <8/10 pass → Revise analysis ⛔
Only deliver when 10/10 pass → "Correct Reasoning Chain" ensured ✅
```
