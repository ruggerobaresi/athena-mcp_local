# Protocol 350: Humanize AI Writing

> **Goal**: Eliminate "robotic" AI markers from generated text to improve resonance, specificty, and trust.
> **Source**: r/ChatGPTPro ("Another trick to make AI writing sound more human")

## 1. The Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

AI models have distinct tell-tales often flagged by Wikipedia and human readers.

| Pattern | Description | Example to Avoid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inflated Language** | Grandiose, promotional adjectives. | "pivotal moment", "testament to", "breathtaking", "unparalleled" |
| **Vague Attribution** | Unnamed experts or general consensus. | "Many experts agree", "It is worth noting that", "Recent studies show" (without citation) |
| **Formulaic Hedges** | Filler phrases that add zero value. | "It is important to remember", "Overall", "In summary", "On the other hand" |
| **Uniform Rhythm** | Paragraphs of equal length and sentence structure. | (A text block where every sentence is 15-20 words long) |
| **The "Rule of Three"** | Forcing lists of exactly three items. | "Fast, scalable, and secure." (Use 2 or 4 to break pattern) |
| **Redundant Conjunctives** | Excessive transitions. | "Moreover", "Furthermore", "In addition", "However" (used every other sentences) |
| **Assistant Artifacts** | Meta-commentary. | "I hope this helps!", "As an AI language model..." |

## 2. The Instruction Prompt (System Prompt)

Use this block when instructing an agent to write content:

```text
# WRITING GUIDELINES: HUMANIZATION PROTOCOL 350

1. **Specifics > Generalities**: Replace vague summaries with concrete details. Do not say "changes were made"; say "we updated the API to v2".
2. **Cut Failure Words**: Delete "In order to", "At this point in time", "It is worth noting that".
3. **No Promotional Fluff**: Remove "Breathtaking", "Revolutionary", "Pivotal", "Testament to". Use plain descriptors.
4. **Vary Syntax**: Mix very short sentences (2-5 words) with longer, complex ones. Break the mechanic rhythm.
5. **Direct Phrasing**: Avoid hedging. Instead of "It could be argued that X is...", say "X is...".
6. **No "Conclusion" Templates**: Do not end with "In conclusion," or "Overall,". Just stop when the point is made.
7. **Limit Em-Dashes**: AI overuses them—restrict to 1 per 3 paragraphs.
```

## 3. The "Wikipedia Test"

Before publishing, scan for these Wikipedia-flagged "Peacock Terms":

* Legendary
* World-class
* Celebrated
* Visionary
* Cutting-edge
* Innovative (unless specifying *how*)

> **Rule**: If you can't prove it with a number or a citation, delete the adjective.

## 4. Execution Example

**Bad (AI Style):**
> "It is important to recognize that the integration of AI represents a pivotal moment in software history. Moreover, many experts agree that this revolutionary technology will offer breathtaking efficiency. Overall, the future looks bright."

**Good (Human Style):**
> "AI integration marks a shift in software history. It's not just about speed; it's about offloading cognition. While critics worry about job loss, the efficiency gains—specifically in data processing—are measurable. The future isn't guaranteed, but it's certainly faster."

## 5. Integration

* **When to use**: Blog posts, emails, documentation intros, and public communications.
* **When to skip**: Technical logs, raw data dumps, and internal API specs where "robotic" precision is preferred.
