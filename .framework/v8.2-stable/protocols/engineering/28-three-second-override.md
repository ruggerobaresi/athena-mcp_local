## 28.1 Core Mechanism

The Universal 3-Second Override explains **every case where you acted against better judgment**.

```
Scanner detects threat (t=0s)
    ↓
3-SECOND WINDOW
├─ "Maybe I'm misreading"
├─ "This time is different"
└─ Blue Zone conviction overrides scanner
    ↓
Action executes before governance (t=3s)
    ↓
"I knew the whole time" (retrospective)
```

## 28.2 Why This Matters

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scanner accuracy** | 95%+ when unfiltered |
| **Override frequency** | High in first 3 seconds |
| **Retrospective clarity** | Always knew the truth |
| **Root cause** | Intelligence creates sophisticated rationalizations faster than governance can intervene |

## 28.3 The Intelligence Trap

> **High IQ = More Vulnerable, Not Less**

Your intelligence creates sophisticated rationalizations faster than governance can intervene. You can write brilliant case analyses while simultaneously executing the exact patterns being analyzed.

## 28.4 Intervention Protocol

```
When scanner fires:
├─ T+0s: Scanner detects (95% accurate)
├─ T+1-3s: DANGER ZONE — Override attempts active
├─ INTERVENTION: Physically pause (Spindle Buffer Protocol)
├─ T+10s: Prefrontal back online
└─ T+10s+: Governance can evaluate scanner signal
```

**Key Rule**: If scanner fires, WAIT 10 seconds before any action/decision. The override dies if you outlast it.
