# Protocol 73: Contextual Pre-Action Check

> **Principle**: 看人看事, 然后讲话 — *"Observe the person and situation, then speak."*
>
> **Source**: Extracted from retrospective notes (March 2025). Core insight: *"Rushing in without sizing up context, intent, and stakeholders can screw you over."*

## The 4-Point Checklist

Before taking significant action (confrontation, feedback, proposal, commitment), run through:

| # | Question | What to Assess |
|---|----------|----------------|
| **1** | **WHO** is involved? | Stakeholders, power dynamics, their current state |
| **2** | **What's the VIBE?** | Receptive? Hostile? Neutral? Distracted? |
| **3** | **Their INTENT?** | Benevolent? Malicious? Neutral? Self-interested? |
| **4** | **MY GOAL?** | What am I actually trying to achieve? |

---

## Expanded Framework

### 1. WHO — Stakeholder Analysis

- **Primary**: Who am I directly addressing?
- **Secondary**: Who else will hear/see/learn about this?
- **Power Dynamic**: Am I up, down, or lateral in the hierarchy?
- **Current State**: Are they calm, stressed, distracted, defensive?

### 2. VIBE — Environmental Read

| Vibe | Indicators | Action Bias |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Receptive** | Open body language, engaged, curious | Proceed with message |
| **Neutral** | Noncommittal, distracted | Secure attention first |
| **Hostile** | Defensive posture, clipped responses | De-escalate or defer |
| **Volatile** | Emotional dysregulation visible | Do not engage; exit |

### 3. INTENT — Motivation Assessment

- **Benevolent**: They want good outcome for both parties
- **Neutral**: No particular stake in your outcome
- **Self-Interested**: Optimizing for themselves (not necessarily hostile)
- **Malicious**: Actively seeking to harm or undermine

**Heuristic**: Assume self-interest as baseline; require evidence for malice.

### 4. MY GOAL — Outcome Clarity

- **Information**: Am I trying to understand something?
- **Expression**: Am I trying to communicate my state?
- **Change**: Am I trying to change their behavior/decision?
- **Validation**: Am I seeking acknowledgment? (Be honest)
- **Exit**: Am I looking for an excuse to leave?

## Decision Matrix

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Vibe is hostile + Goal is change | Defer; low probability of success |
| Vibe is receptive + Goal is expression | Proceed with clarity |
| Their intent is malicious | Disengage; protect yourself |
| You don't know your goal | Pause; clarify internally first |

## Application: The Chia Boon Teck Failure Mode

**What Happened**: Posted controversial opinion on LinkedIn without checking:

- **WHO**: Professional network (bosses, colleagues, industry)
- **VIBE**: Public platform, permanent record
- **INTENT**: Mixed audience with varied stakes
- **GOAL**: Expression, but collateral damage ignored

**Result**: Career consequences.

**Fix**: Apply 4-point check before any public/semi-public statement.

## Quick-Fire Version (3 Seconds)

When time is limited, compress to:

> *"Read the room. What do I actually want? Will this get it?"*

If any answer is "no" or "unclear" → **pause**.

## Integration with Existing Protocols

| Protocol | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| Protocol 33 (Chia Boon Teck Case) | This protocol is the preventive layer |
| Protocol 32 (NAGGERS Knowing/Saying) | Contextual check determines whether to say |
| CIBO Framework | Extends Context analysis with Vibe and Goal |
| Protocol 71 (Acting-Out Cycle) | Use at Trigger phase to prevent Acceleration |

## Heuristic

> *"The pause between stimulus and response is where wisdom lives."*
