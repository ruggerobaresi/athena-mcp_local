# Protocol 72: Proactive Extrapolation Framework (PEF)

> **Source**: Extracted from retrospective notes (May 2025). Core insight: *"Take early warning signs of success/failure and project into the future to proactively avoid train wrecks."*

## Phase 1: Signal Detection

### What to Scan For

| Signal Type | Examples | Weight |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Behavioral** | Repeated cancellations, evasive answers, enthusiasm drop | High |
| **Verbal** | "We'll see," "Maybe," "I'm busy" (soft rejections) | Medium |
| **Contextual** | Power imbalances, misaligned incentives, history of similar | High |
| **Intuitive** | "Something feels off" (vibe check) | Medium* |

*Intuitive signals validated by experience carry higher weight.

### Significance Filter

- **Is this a pattern or isolated event?** (2+ occurrences = pattern)
- **Does this contradict stated intent?** (Words-Vibes Mismatch)
- **What's the base rate for this behavior?** (Bayesian prior)

---

## Phase 2: Projection

### Scenario Matrix

| EWS Classification | Best Case | Worst Case | Most Likely |
|--------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Positive EWS** | Accelerated success | Neutral | Modest gain |
| **Neutral EWS** | Surprise upside | Gradual decline | Status quo |
| **Negative EWS** | Misread signal | Full train wreck | Predicted failure |

### Key Question

> *"If this signal continues on its current trajectory, where does it end up in 1 week / 1 month / 1 year?"*

---

## Phase 3: Decision Matrix

| EWS Type | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Positive** | Amplify / Accelerate | Double down on what's working |
| **Moderate Negative** | Mitigate / Correct | Address issue before it compounds |
| **Severe Negative** | Disengage / Exit | Cut losses; sunk cost irrelevant |

### The "Train Wreck" Test

Before committing further resources (time, money, emotion), ask:

1. **What are the EWS I'm observing?**
2. **If I extrapolate these, what's the likely destination?**
3. **Am I already seeing the early frames of a train wreck?**
4. **What would I advise a friend seeing these same signals?**

---

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Friend Repeatedly Cancelling

| Phase | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Signal | 2nd cancellation with vague excuse |
| Projection | Pattern suggests low priority; likely to continue |
| Decision | Stop initiating; redirect energy |

### Example 2: Business with Lukewarm Response

| Phase | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Signal | Low conversion, ghosting after initial interest |
| Projection | Market doesn't want this at this price/form |
| Decision | Pivot, reprice, or exit before sunk cost grows |

---

## Integration with Existing Protocols

| Protocol | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| Protocol 18 (Probabilistic Stack) | PEF is qualitative pre-filter before quantitative analysis |
| Protocol 34 (Rigged Game) | Severe negative EWS = rigged game detection |
| Law #3 (Revealed Preference) | Behavioral EWS > stated intent |
| Protocol 48 (Circuit Breaker) | Cumulative negative EWS triggers circuit breaker |

## Heuristic

> *"The best time to exit a bad situation was at the first signal. The second best time is now."*
