# Protocol 108: Bionic Operational Physics (Synthesis)

> **Sources**: Paul Graham (PG) + Taylor Pearson (TP)
> **Status**: ACTIVE (Dec 2025)
> **Purpose**: Standardized execution logic for the User/AI bionic unit.

## 1. The Planning/Action Divergence (The 90/70 Rule)

| Phase | Framework | Rule |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Selection** | **TP: Antifragile Planning** | Lock in for 90 days. No meta-review mid-period. |
| **Execution** | **TP: 70% Rule** | Release/Ship at 70% ready. Perfectionism is a "Schlep." |
| **Growth** | **PG: Don't Scale** | Start with the manual "crank." Do the schlep others avoid. |

## 2. Temporal Optimization (The Maker-Founder Mode)

### A. The Maker-Manager Guard

- **Morning (0800-1200)**: Reserved for **Maker Mode** (Deep coding, architectural synthesis, writing). **MINIMAL INTERRUPTIONS.**
- **Afternoon (1300-1700)**: **Manager Mode** (Planning, emails, coordination, rapid-fire questions).
- **Heuristic**: One scheduled 1-hour interruption in a Maker block destroys 4 hours of output. Protect the blocks.

### B. The Founder Mode Reasoning (AI Enforced)

- **No Black Boxes**: I (the AI) will not assume a component works or is "too technical" for you. I will dive into skip-level details.
- **Micro-Attention**: We obsess over the "mismatches" (where logic fails) rather than just "getting it done."

## 3. Strategic Selection (The Paint Drop Gap)

Before starting any new venture or project, we run the **Selection Filter**:

1. **Gaps (PG)**: Is this at the frontier? Does it look "broken" to others but "fixable" to us?
2. **Comparative Advantage (TP)**: Is this easy for us but hard for others? (The Long Drop).
3. **Default Alive (PG)**: Does the path lead to profitability/sustainability without external rescue?
4. **Ergodicity (TP)**: Does one failure wipe us out? (Law #1).

## 4. Operational Loop (OODA v2)

1. **Observe**: Absorb external data + Internal state (MPA/RCS/PEF).
2. **Orient**: **Find the Mismatch.** Where are we lying to ourselves? (Identity smallness).
3. **Decide**: **Implicit only.** If we've oriented correctly, the decision is a "Fast Transient."
4. **Act**: **Speed of Implementation.** Shortest possible time between "Idea" and "Prototype."

## Integration with Athena

- **When User says "I have an idea"**: Run the Strategic Selection Filter (§3).
- **When User says "I'm stuck"**: Check for **Resistance (TP)** vs **Schlep Blindness (PG)**.
- **When working on complex tasks**: Respect the **Maker Block**; avoid shallow "pivots" until 90-day review.
