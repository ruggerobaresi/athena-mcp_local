# Protocol 70: Agentic Absorption

> **Status**: ACTIVE (Harvested Dec 2025)
> **Tags**: #agentic #absorption #knowledge-harvesting #meta #protocol

---

## Core Principle

**Years of human work → Minutes of AI integration.**

The asymmetry is time compression. Public knowledge (papers, repos, docs) can be absorbed and operationalized faster than creators can monetize it.

---

## The Formula

```
Human Work (months/years)  
    × AI Parsing (seconds)  
    × Agentic Integration (minutes)  
    = Compound capability at inhuman speed
```

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this protocol when you encounter:

1. **GitHub Repo** with valuable patterns/tools
2. **Research Paper** with novel algorithms
3. **Documentation** for a useful service/API
4. **Forum Thread** with distilled expertise

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Identify Source

- URL, paper, or repo with high signal-to-noise ratio
- Prioritize: MIT/Apache licensed, well-documented, actively maintained

### 2. Parse & Extract

- Feed to AI for summarization
- Extract: core algorithms, key patterns, integration points
- Ignore: boilerplate, legacy cruft, irrelevant features

### 3. Integrate

- Create local protocol/capability file if pattern is reusable
- Update `SKILL_INDEX.md` with new capability
- Add to `TAG_INDEX.md` via `generate_tag_index.py`

### 4. Document Attribution

- Record source URL in protocol file
- Note license restrictions if any
- Mark as "Harvested [Month Year]"

## Execution Time Benchmarks

| Source Type | Parse Time | Integration Time | Total |
|-------------|------------|------------------|-------|
| GitHub README | 30 sec | 2 min | **~3 min** |
| Research Paper | 2 min | 5 min | **~7 min** |
| Full Codebase | 5 min | 10 min | **~15 min** |
| Documentation Site | 1 min | 3 min | **~4 min** |

## Strategic Implications

### Dead Moats (No Longer Defensible)

- "I published first" — AI implements faster than peer review
- "I have deep domain expertise" — AI absorbs expertise from papers
- "My code is proprietary" — If described anywhere, it can be reconstructed

### Surviving Moats

- **Proprietary data** (not publicly described)
- **Network effects** (users locked in)
- **Regulatory capture** (legal barriers)
- **Speed + relationships** (first to customer, trusted)

## Example: DeepCode Integration

**Source**: `github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode`
**Time to Absorb**: 5 minutes
**Capability Gained**: Paper2Code automation

The irony: DeepCode itself is a tool for Agentic Absorption. Using it to absorb it is recursive.
