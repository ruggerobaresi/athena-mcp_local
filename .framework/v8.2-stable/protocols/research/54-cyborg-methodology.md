# Protocol 54: Cyborg Methodology (Jagged Frontier Defense)

> **Purpose**: Prevent "Sleeping at the Wheel" (Centaur Mode failure) by enforcing integrated, granular, iterative AI collaboration.  
> **Source**: Dell'Acqua et al. (2023). *Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier*. Harvard Business School.  
> **Trigger**: Any high-stakes or complex task strategy.

## 1. The Core Distinction

| Feature | 🐎 Centaur Mode (OLD) | 🦾 Cyborg Mode (NEW/GTO) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Metaphor** | Manager + Intern | Exoskeleton / Bionic Limb |
| **Interaction** | Handoff → Wait → Review | Continuous Loop (Sentence-level) |
| **Granularity** | Document / Task Level | Micro-Task / Logic Level |
| **Inside Frontier** | ✅ Efficient | ✅ Powerful |
| **Outside Frontier** | ☠️ **-19% Accuracy** (Sleeping Risk) | 🛡️ **Mitigated** (Constant Audit) |
| **Risk** | "Lazy Delegation" | "Model Collapse" (requires human lead) |

> **The Trap**: When experts delegate to AI (Centaur) on tasks just outside the AI's capability frontier, they perform **worse** than if they worked alone, because the AI produces "plausible nonsense" that lulls the expert into trusting it.

## 2. The Cyborg Workflow (Recursive Integration)

**Do not** ask for a "final deliverable."  
**Do** weave the output through micro-loops.

### Step 1: The Skeleton (Human Lead)

* **Human** defines the L0 Graph of Thought (GoT).
* **Human** sets the constraints and success criteria.
* *Never delegate the architecture.*

### Step 2: The Weave (Iterative Loop)

For each component of the skeleton:

1. **Drafting**: "Draft [Component A] with [Specific Tone]."
2. **Friction**: Interrupt the generation if it drifts.
    * *"Stop. That's too generic. Pivot to [Counter-intuitive Angle]."*
3. **Critique**: "Critique your last output against [Constraint X]."
4. **Refine**: "Rewrite leveraging that critique."

### Step 3: The Audit (Jagged Frontier Check)

* Assume the AI is hallucinating 10% of the time.
* **Verify** specific claims, dates, and logic chains.
* **Synthesize** the pieces manually (or oversee the synthesis closely).

## 3. Power Phrases (Cyborg Activation)

* **"Stop. Reroute."** (Real-time course correction)
* **"Critique your own logic."** (Forcing self-reflection)
* **"Draft only the first paragraph."** (Preventing runaway generation)
* **"What is the counter-argument to what you just said?"** (Adversarial stress-test)
* **"Assume I am wrong. Why might that be?"** (Breaking confirmation bias)

## 4. When to Use Which

| Mode | Use Case | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Centaur** | Low-risk, high-volume, well-defined tasks within proven frontier. | "Write a generic email," "Format this data," "Summarize this clean text." |
| **Cyborg** | High-stakes, ambiguous, strategic, or "outside frontier" tasks. | "Develop a new strategy," "Diagnose a complex bug," "Nuanced negotiation script." |

> **Rule**: If the outcome determines >=L3 success, **CYBORG MODE ONLY**.
