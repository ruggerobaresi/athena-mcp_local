## 1. The Core Principle

**The Forward-Only Heuristic**:
When a structural break occurs (betrayal, firing, loss), the question *"How do I fix this?"* is often a syntax error. It assumes the previous state is recoverable.

The correct syntax is:
**"Given Current_State(t), what is the optimal vector to Desired_State(t+1)?"**

### The Structural Isomorphism

| Scenario | The "Fix It" Trap (Invalid) | The Forward-Only View (Valid) |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cheating GF** | "How do I un-cheat/trust her again?" | "Is this a casual hookup or do I exit?" |
| **PIP / Firing** | "How do I prove I was right?" | "Where is my next paycheck coming from?" |
| **Market Loss** | "How do I make the money back?" | "What is the best trade *right now*?" |
| **Shattered Trust** | "How do we get back to how it was?" | "What is the new relationship contract?" |

## 2. The Decision Matrix

When facing a negative discontinuity, map to this grid:

| State | Backward Question (❌) | Forward Question (✅) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Irreversible** | "Why did this happen?" | "What is the new baseline?" |
| **Sunk Cost** | "But I invested so much..." | " Is the *next* unit of investment +EV?" |
| **Damage** | "Who is at fault?" | "How do I mitigate further loss?" |

### The "Virgin Friend" Corollary

*From Session 37 Analysis*

> "The question is NOT how can I undo crossing a boundary. The question is: Is this a casual arrangement or a commitment?"

**Rule**: Once a boundary is crossed (professional to PIP, friend to lover, loyalty to betrayal), the old entity is dead. **Do not perform CPR on a corpse.** birth the new entity or walk away.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Acknowledge The Death**: Explicitly state: "The previous version of this game/relationship is over."
2. **Zero-Base the Asset**: If I didn't own this stock/job/friendship today, would I buy/start it from scratch?
    * If **NO** → **Immediate Exit**.
    * If **YES** → **Renegotiate Terms**.
3. **Define the New Game**:
    * Not "repairing the old" but "building the new."
    * Set new parameters based on the *revealed reality* (De Facto), not the old hope (De Jure).

## 4. The Political Capital Asymmetry

*Applied to Corporate/Social Contexts*

Political capital is **insurance**.

* **Time to buy**: BEFORE the fire.
* **Time to claim**: DURING the fire.
* **Invalid State**: Trying to buy insurance *while* the house burns.

**Forward-Only Move in Crisis**:
If you lack insurance during a fire, **abandon the house**. Do not try to negotiate with the flames.

## 5. Summary

> **You don't litigate the past. You navigate the future.**
