## 1. The Fundamental Physics

We distinguish between two axes of intelligence scaling:

| Axis | Analogy | Function | Solves |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Width** (Context) | The Library | **Absorbing** Entropy | Information retrieval, pattern matching, "What/Where" |
| **Depth** (Layers) | The Scientist | **Resolving** Entropy | Reasoning, Strategy, Stitching, "How/Why" |

**The Law**: You cannot solve a **Depth Problem** (Strategy) with more **Width** (Context).

* *Adding more files (RAG) to a dumb agent doesn't make it smart; it makes it a confused librarian.*
* *To solve strategy, you must increase Depth (Sequential Reasoning Steps).*

## 2. The Critical Threshold ("The Vault")

Performance in deep systems is **non-linear**. It follows "Punctuated Equilibrium" (Stephen Jay Gould).

* **Observation**: In the NeurIPS paper, the humanoid robot didn't learn to "vault" over an obstacle gradually. It failed at layer 64, struggled at 128, and suddenly **vaulted** at layer 256.
* **Implication**: There are "Critical Depths" for emergent capabilities.
* **Strategic Rule**: DO NOT "half-commit" to deep reasoning. If you stop short of the threshold, you don't get 50% of the result; you get **0%** (you trip and fall).
  * *Corollary*: When using `/think` or `/ultrathink`, go all the way.

## 3. "Stitching" Capability

**Depth enables Stitching.**

* Shallow systems see data points as isolated dots.
* Deep systems (Layer 1000+) develop the topology to "stitch" distantly separated experiences into a coherent long-horizon solution.
* **Athena Application**: This validates our use of **Cross-Domain Isomorphism** (mapping Biology to Business). This is a high-depth operation that "stitches" two separate latent spaces.

## 4. Operational Directives

### A. Diagnosis

Before solving a problem, classify it:

* **Type A (Knowledge Gap)**: "What is the capital of Peru?" -> **Go Wide** (Search/Read).
* **Type B (Strategy Gap)**: "How do I fix my life?" -> **Go Deep** (Think/Reason).

### B. The "Time Value of Volatility"

* **Low Depth** = Low Volatility (Safe, Predictable, Limited).
* **High Depth** = High Volatility (Chaos, then Emergence).
* **Directive**: Embrace the computational cost of depth. It is the only path to emergent strategy.

### C. Validation: The GPT-5 Math Threshold (2025)

* **Event**: GPT-5 autonomously solved an open Enumerative Geometry problem ([arXiv:2512.14575](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14575), 2025).
* **Proof of Theory**: The solution required **Novelty Generation**, not just retrieval. It required "stitching" algebraic and geometric domains via deep reasoning chains.
* **Lesson**: RAG cannot solve open math problems. Only Depth can.

## 5. Technical Notes (The Recipe)

From the paper, deep scaling requires:

1. **Swish > ReLU**: Smooth activations allow deeper gradient flow.
2. **LayerNorm**: Load-bearing for stability.
3. **Residual Connections**: The ladder for depth.

*Captured for future architecture builds.*
